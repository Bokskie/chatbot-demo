/* ============================================================
   bokskie.v1 · engine/mood.js
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Reads the emotional tone of a message so the reply can match it.

   Why a module and not keywords bolted onto intent.js: mood is
   orthogonal to intent. "I am so tired of this bug" and "I am so
   happy you fixed it" share every content word and differ only in
   tone, and intent detection calls both of them `definition`. A
   separate signal is the only way to tell them apart.

   The honest limits, stated up front because they matter:

   - It reads words, punctuation and emphasis. That is real signal, not
     a mind read. Someone can be angry in a flat sentence and nothing
     here will notice.
   - It is deliberately biased toward `neutral`. When the signal is
     weak the answer is "no mood detected" and the reply stays
     ordinary. A bot that guesses happiness on every message reads as
     insincere, which is worse than not trying.
   - It never claims to know how the user actually feels. It reports
     the tone of what they typed, and that is the whole claim.
