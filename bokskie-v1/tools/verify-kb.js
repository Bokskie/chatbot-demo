   Reports, and fails on: malformed JSON, duplicate ids, duplicate
   concepts, near-duplicate answers, empty or too-thin answers, missing
   required fields, malformed ids, and shelf sizes below --min.

   The duplicate check is the one that matters. A bank can pass every
   structural test and still be worse than a small one, because a
   thousand rows that say the same thing raise the score of whichever
   entry they all resemble and push real answers below the refusal
   threshold. That failure is invisible from inside the app - it just
   looks like the bot getting vaguer - so it is checked here.
