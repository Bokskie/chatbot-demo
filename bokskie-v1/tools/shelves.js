   bokskie-v1 · tools/shelves.js
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   THE SHELF REGISTRY - and therefore the shape of the whole
   knowledge base. One row per JSON file the bank is made of,
   organised as the tree a person actually browses:

     Cebuano
       +-- Basic words
       +-- Greetings
       +-- ...

   TREE below is that tree. Everything else in this file is
   DERIVED from it - `shelves`, `byId`, the id prefixes, the
   router keys. There is no second table to keep in step, which
   is the whole point: this used to be three hardcoded tables
   (SHELVES in build-kb.js, SHELVES in verify-kb.js, TOPICS in
   engine/intent.js), so adding a category meant editing three
   places and remembering all three. Forgetting one produced a
   shelf that built fine and could never be routed to, which is
   the worst kind of bug: it looks like a weak answer rather
   than a missing table.

   ROW FORMAT, per subcategory
     [ slug, Title, routerKeys ]

       slug   kebab-case id. data/<group>-<slug>.json and
              tools/source/<group>-<slug>.kb are both named
              after it, so the tree is greppable end to end.
       Title  display name. Goes into the JSON and the bundle so
              a UI can render the tree without hardcoding labels.
       keys   router keywords, comma separated, and ONLY for
              words a person would type that are not already
              the shelf name. Optional.

   WHY `keys` MUST BE STEMMED
   --------------------------
   The router matches against tokens, and tokens are stemmed, so
   "programming" as a key can never fire - the stemmer yields
   "programm". That shipped, took the 0.55x off-topic penalty on
   correct answers, and made a bare "lets talk about programming"
   refuse. verify-kb.js now lints every declared key for exactly
   this, so a new shelf cannot reintroduce it.

   The same trap catches the shelf NAME, because
   engine/intent.js derives a key from every word in `sub`. A
   sub called "conversations" contributes the key
   "conversations", which tokenize() can never produce. So any
   sub whose word stems differently must also list the stemmed
   form in `keys`. The lint reports those too.

   WHY ids CARRY THE SUB
   ---------------------
   `prefix` used to be per-GROUP, so every shelf in a group
   started at 000001: ceb-basic-words-000001 and
   ceb-greetings-000001 were the same id. kb.byId is a plain
   object, so the second one silently overwrote the first and a
   lookup could return an entry from the wrong shelf. Ids are now
   groupPrefix + sub, which is unique by construction, and
   assertPrefixes() fails the build if that ever stops being true.
   ============================================================ */

var path = require("path");

/* The engine's own stemmer, so a shelf author writes "greetings" and
   the router receives "greet". Without this, `keys` had to be written
   pre-stemmed by hand, which is a trap you cannot see: a key that is
   not already stemmed is a key nothing can ever produce, so the shelf
   loads, validates, and is simply never routed to. The symptom is a
   vague answer rather than a config error, which is the worst kind.

   This is a node-only require and that is fine - shelves.js is
   consumed by the build tools and by engine/index.js's node branch
   only. The browser gets its copy from the generated bundle, which
   carries the already-normalised values. */
var T = require(path.join(__dirname, "..", "engine", "tokenizer.js"));

/* One pass, and that is the whole point.

   tokenize() calls the stemmer exactly once per word, so a key must
   be stemmed exactly once to be the same string the router compares
   against. Peeling to a fixed point looked tidier and was wrong:
   "nursing" stems once to "nurs", which IS the token, and then stems
   again to "nur", which is nothing anyone types. The over-stemmed key
   was dead, so "is nursing hard" routed to no topic at all and
   refused, while the nursing shelf sat there fully written.

   A single pass is also self-consistent, which is what the lint needs:
   "phrases" stems once to "phras", and stemming "phras" changes
   nothing, so a stored "phras" is never flagged. Two stems that end
   up equal is not a thing to avoid, it is a thing to have. */

     the subject words - colonize, spain, edsa, traffic, jeepney -
