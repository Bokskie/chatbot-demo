   Requirement: growing the bank must not slow the engine down, and
   must not quietly loosen it. Both are checked here, because both are
   the kind of regression that shows up as "the bot got vaguer" months
   later with nothing in the logs.

   The synthetic rows are deliberately the WORST case for retrieval,
   not a flattering one: every row shares the same vocabulary, and the
   query words are chosen to match thousands of them at once. That is
   the scenario that breaks an inverted index with a large posting
   list, and it is the reason candidate generation exists. A scale
   test made of easy queries proves nothing.
